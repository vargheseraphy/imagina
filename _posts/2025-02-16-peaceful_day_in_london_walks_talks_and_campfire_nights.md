**My Future Diary - October 10, 202X**

Today is a warm and sunny day in October. After a long time, I enjoyed a delicious Kerala breakfast – puttu and egg curry. I’m here with my mentor, Go, in London. Last night, we had a deep conversation, and as always, he was very inspiring.  

This morning, we went for a walk along the old water canal. It was peaceful, with birds chirping and whistling all around. The ground was covered with violet flowers, soft like a royal mattress. We walked on a tiled, wavy path and talked about cultural differences and how polite English people are. Go shared the history of the canal and told me about the people who live on boats there. I wanted to try fishing, but Go wasn’t interested, so we kept walking.  

After walking 8 km, we stopped at an old coffee shop made of red bricks. It felt like a heritage building. We sat in a quiet corner near some bushes. An elderly lady with silver-white hair took our order. I wanted tea, but they only had coffee. The hot coffee gave us energy to continue our walk.  

By 2 pm, we were back home, and I took a long nap. When I woke up, I felt refreshed. In the evening, we set up a campfire in the courtyard and grilled chicken. Go’s family joined us. His daughter sang beautiful songs while he played the ukulele. I tried drumming on a bucket, but it didn’t work out. Still, the night was wonderful, and we all enjoyed it. :)
